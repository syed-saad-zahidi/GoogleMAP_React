# React Google Maps Application

This is a simple React application that uses the Google Maps API to display a map with various features like drawing shapes and searching for places.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syed-saad-zahidi/GoogleMap-React.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GoogleMap-React
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Add your Google Maps API key:

Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with your actual Google Maps API key in the `GoogleMap.tsx` file.

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- Display a Google Map with the ability to draw shapes (polygon, circle, and rectangle).
- Search for places using the autocomplete feature.
- Clear the drawn shapes.

## How to Use

1. Once the application is running, you can see the map with various options on the left-hand side.
2. To draw a shape, select the desired shape (polygon, circle, or rectangle) from the options and click on the map to start drawing. You can continue to click on the map to add vertices for the polygon or adjust the shape of the circle/rectangle. Double-click to finish drawing.
3. To search for a place, type the place name in the search box and select the result from the dropdown. The map will automatically zoom to the selected location.
4. To clear the drawn shapes, click the "Clear" button on the map.
